run `go build && ./calendar` and open `http://localhost:8080`

## TODO
+ not yet planed events list
+ event placing
+ correct month swapping (almost, it can fail with fast month scrolling)
+ correct scrolling (it's laggy)

Constrain solution:
+ location \w personal

## Browsers quirks

for some reason
